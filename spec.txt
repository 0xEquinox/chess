Basic Requirements:

    8x8 playing board, only one piece can be on a single square

    Player Black's pieces are in lowercase, Player White's pieces are in uppercase

    Pieces: Each player starts with...

        8 pawns on their second row (black starts from top, white starts from bottom)

        2 rooks in the corners of their first row

        2 knights next to the rooks

        2 bishops are next to the knights

        the white queen on the left of the white king next to the knights

        the black queen and black king above the respective white pieces in the first row for player Black.

    Movement

        rooks can move horizontally or vertically

        bishops can move in diagonals

        queens can move horizontally or vertically or diagonally

        kings can move horizontally or vertically or diagonally by one square

        knights can move one square horizontally or vertically and then one square diagonally outward (away from the original position). This looks like an L shape.

        Pawns move one square vertically, away from the rows where the player's pieces start.

    pieces can capture and remove other pieces by landing on the square that the piece is on

    the game ends when the loser's king is captured (no checkmates), a winner will be declared

Extended Requirements:

    the game ends when an individual's king can be captured on opponents next move but the individual has no move to prevent this from happening (checkmate)

    implement pawn double move (on first move)

    implement en passant (special case where pawn can be captured without landing on the direct square)

    implement pawn promotion (where pawn can convert to a non-king piece if it reaches the end of the chess board)

    implement castling (where king can move behind a rook if not in line of check)

    implement forfeiting and draw offers
